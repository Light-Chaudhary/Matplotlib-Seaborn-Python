# üìä Data Visualization Projects with Matplotlib & Seaborn

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly data visualization projects using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. Each script explores different types of charts and plots to visualize data in meaningful ways.

## ‚úÖ Completed Programs

---

### **1. Mobile OS Market Share**
- **Visualizations:** Pie Chart, Horizontal Bar Chart  
- **Description:** Compares the global market share of mobile operating systems ‚Äî Android, iOS, and Others.  
- **Goal:** Compare readability and clarity between a pie chart and a bar chart.

---

### **2. Daily Activity Schedule**
- **Visualization:** Stack Plot  
- **Description:** Shows how time is spent on various daily activities (Programming, Workout, Studying, Sleeping) over four days.  
- **Goal:** Understand cumulative stacked time visualization.

---

### **3. Exam Scores Distribution**
- **Visualization:** Histogram  
- **Description:** Displays the frequency distribution of exam scores across defined score ranges (bins).  
- **Goal:** Identify how scores are distributed and where most students fall.

---

### **4. Height vs Weight Comparison**
- **Visualization:** Scatter Plot (with colormap)  
- **Description:** Plots height vs weight and uses color (via colormap) to represent height.  
- **Goal:** Understand relationships between continuous variables using scatter plots.

---

### **5. Group-wise Height vs Weight**
- **Visualization:** Subplots of Scatter Plots  
- **Description:** Compares three different groups' height and weight using subplots.  
- **Goal:** Visual comparison of trends across multiple datasets.

---

### **6. Bill Length vs Bill Depth**
- **Visualization:** Seaborn Scatter Plot with hue, style, and size  
- **Description:** Uses the Palmer Penguins dataset to visualize the relationship between bill dimensions with color, style, and size encoding.  
- **Goal:** Explore multi-dimensional relationships using Seaborn.
